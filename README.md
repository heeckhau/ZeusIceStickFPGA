This repository contains support material for a presentation and Workshop with @ZeusWIP at the Ghent University.

The vagrant file builds a VirtualBox image that can be used to compile VHDL sources and upload them to an iCEstick (FPGA).

The presentation can be found at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RCUnVSiadrWwErMau3-oa2BuJt87Ry_DHvM3xSSpfRk/edit?usp=sharing

The VHDL file for the blinking LEDS was originally written by Tristan Gingold (see ihttps://github.com/tgingold/ghdlsynth-beta)
